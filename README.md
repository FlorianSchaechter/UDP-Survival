# UDP-Survival
This project is a work in progress.

When finished, this tool will send multiple UDP-Packets to a host, to figure out exactly how many UDP packets are dropped during transport. 
## Motivation
Reliability is one of the key difference between UDP and TCP. But exactly how unreliable is UDP? To answer this question I will make some experiments.
